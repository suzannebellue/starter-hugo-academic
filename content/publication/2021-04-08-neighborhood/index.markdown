abstract: 'Neighborhoods in the US shape future economics outcomes of children who grow up in them, and their endogenous demographic composition define who are the role models for those children. I develop and estimate a structural spatial equilibrium model of parental investments in which residential choices exogenously impact the human capital formation of children, and endogenously shape their expectations about the returns to educational investments. Under the assumption that agents are unable to per- fectly estimate the bias that spatial sorting introduces, this model generates persistent misbeliefs about returns to educational investment that are correlated with earnings. The estimated model captures empirical patterns regarding the correlation between subjective beliefs and earnings, intergenerational mobility and residential choices. A housing quota policy that would allow disadvantaged children to live in a more favorable neighborhood would have a positive effect on human capital and expectations of the beneficiaries due to improved local human capital formation and demographic composition. However, relatively low and sticky beliefs about returns to educational investments dampen the effect on intergenerational mobility.'

Neighborhoods in the US shape future economics outcomes of children who grow up in them, and their endogenous demographic composition define who are the role models for those children. I develop and estimate a structural spatial equilibrium model of parental investments in which residential choices exogenously impact the human capital formation of children, and endogenously shape their expectations about the returns to educational investments. Under the assumption that agents are unable to perfectly estimate the bias that spatial sorting introduces, this model generates persistent misbeliefs about returns to educational investment that are correlated with earnings. The estimated model captures empirical patterns regarding the correlation between subjective beliefs and earnings, intergenerational mobility and residential choices. A housing quota policy that would allow disadvantaged children to live in a more favorable neighborhood would have a positive effect on human capital and expectations of the beneficiaries due to improved local human capital formation and demographic composition.
