We conduct a large randomized study to assess the impact of an in-service teacher training program on inquiry-based teaching in sciences. The randomized study
is conducted in several French primary schools, comprises randomly assigned 134
teachers and two cohorts of about 2500 students. In addition to standardized
student test score, we collect information on teacher quantitative and qualitative
practices and pedagogical knowledge. We find that the training program (80
hours over 2 years) significantly increase the weekly hours of science as well as
the number of hands-on science experiments conducted in class. However, the
program only marginally modified teachers’ pedagogical approach while our data
suggest that very large change would be necessary to produce substantial impacts
on student performances. Consequently, our results on the student performances
are disappointing: impacts are significant only on scientific knowledge and not
on skills and are, in any case, fading out one year after the end of the training.
