I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at [CREST - IP Paris - ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en/research/center-research-economics-and-statistics-crest) and I hold a Ph.D. from [Mannheim University](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/) (2023). I am also affiliated to [RFBerlin](https://www.rfberlin.com). 

My research spans family macroeconomics and development economics, with a focus on the causes and consequences of inequality and social mobility.
