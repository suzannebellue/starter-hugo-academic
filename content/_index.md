Welcome! 


I am a PhD candidate in economics, [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/gess/) at [Mannheim University](https://www.vwl.uni-mannheim.de/en/). My research interests include macroeconomics, public, labor, and development economics.

In [my job market paper](research/neighborhoods/Bellue_JMP_Neighborhoods.pdf), I wonder why poor families don't move. I find that imperfect information about skill formation and social learning within neighborhoods rationalize part of low spatial and social mobility in the U.S. Housing voucher policies, in the long run, can mitigate adverse effects of segregation on inequality and social mobility.

I am on the 2022-23 economics job market and will be available for interviews. 

Find out more about my [research](research) and [CV](uploads/resume.pdf).
