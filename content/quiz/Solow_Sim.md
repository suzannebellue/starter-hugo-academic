answer="An increase in s raises steady-state capital per worker k*."
>}}

{{< solow-question
id="q2"
prompt="Increase population growth n. What happens to steady-state output per worker?"
answer="Higher n lowers steady-state output per worker."
>}}

{{< solow-question
id="q3"
prompt="Does changing n affect the long-run growth rate of output per worker? Why?"
