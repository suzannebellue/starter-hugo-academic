  Thanks for stopping by! I'm a postdoctoral research scientist in the [Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics](https://www.dbei.med.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. My research interests include applications of biomedical informatics in the public and population health fields. I work in the [Boland Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/bolandlab/) on projects that develop novel data mining methods to extract pregnancy-related information from Electronic Health Records (EHR) and study the relationship between environment and disease. Learn more about my research interests in [publications](/publication).
