summary: "Digital cash transfer programs were setup rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic and are increasingly common post-pandemic. In a randomized evaluation, we find that Togo's Novissi program, which identified beneficiaries using poverty proxied by mobile phone data and provided US$13-15 in monthly mobile cash transfers, yielded modestly positive, statistically significant treatment effects on self-reported food security, financial health, and mental health. However, mobile phone data records, previously successful at predicting poverty levels, do not generate similar treatment effects to the survey data. Our results have key implications for using mobile phone data as a proxy for vulnerability in policy impact measurement."
