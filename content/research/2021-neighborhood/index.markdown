summary: "In the United States, parents’ neighborhood choices shape their children’s economic opportunities. However, most children raised in bottom-quality neighborhoods still live in low-quality neighborhoods in adulthood. Do parents' neighborhood choices also affect their children's future choices? After providing empirical evidence on this relationship, I develop a quantitative spatial model of parental decisions that incorporates a novel mechanism: social learning about the technology of skill formation. Segregation generates information frictions that systematically distort parents' subjective beliefs and behavior. Using several United States representative datasets, I calibrate the model to the average commuting zone in the country. The calibrated model helps understand targeted and non-targeted parental behavior across socioeconomic groups. Under perfect information, inequality decreases by 3%, and social mobility increases by 13%. Housing vouchers improve neighborhood quality and earnings of eligible low-income children. At scale, however, general equilibrium responses in local prices and subjective beliefs dampen the policy effects on inequality and social mobility."

**Abstract**:

United States parents’ neighborhood choices shape their children’s economic opportunities. However, most children raised in bottom-quality neighborhoods still live in low-quality neighborhoods in adulthood. Do parents' neighborhood choices also affect their children's future choices? After providing empirical evidence on this relationship, I develop a quantitative spatial model of parental decisions that incorporates a novel mechanism: community learning about the technology of skill formation. Segregation generates information frictions that systematically distort parents' subjective beliefs and behavior. Using several United States representative datasets, I calibrate the model to the average commuting zone in the country. The calibrated model helps understand targeted and non-targeted parental behavior across socioeconomic groups. Under perfect information, inequality decreases by 3%, and social mobility increases by 13%. Housing vouchers improve neighborhood quality and earnings of eligible low-income children. At scale, however, general equilibrium responses in local prices and subjective beliefs dampen the policy effects on inequality and social mobility
