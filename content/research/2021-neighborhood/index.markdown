summary: "United States parents shape children's economic opportunities by choosing their neighborhood quality. But most children raised in bottom-quality neighborhoods tend to choose low-quality neighborhoods in adulthood. I develop a quantitative spatial model of parental decisions that incorporates a novel mechanism: community learning about the skill formation technology. Segregation generates information frictions that systematically distort parents' subjective beliefs and behavior. The calibrated model helps understand parental behavior across socioeconomic groups. Under perfect information, inequality decreases by 1%, and social mobility increases by 13%. Housing vouchers improve neighborhood quality and earnings of eligible children. However, at scale, the policy backfires, increasing inequality."

**Abstract**:

United States parents shape children's economic opportunities by choosing their neighborhood quality. But most children raised in bottom-quality neighborhoods tend to choose low-quality neighborhoods in adulthood. I develop a quantitative spatial model of parental decisions that incorporates a novel mechanism: community learning about the skill formation technology. Segregation generates information frictions that systematically distort parents' subjective beliefs and behavior. The calibrated model helps understand parental behavior across socioeconomic groups. Under perfect information, inequality decreases by 1%, and social mobility increases by 13%. Housing vouchers improve neighborhood quality and earnings of eligible children. However, at scale, the policy backfires, increasing inequality.
