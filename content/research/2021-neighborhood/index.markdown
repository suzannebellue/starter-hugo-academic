summary: "Parents' neighborhood choices shape children’s economic opportunities in the United States. However, most children raised in bottom-quality neighborhoods still live in low-quality neighborhoods in adulthood. Could parents' neighborhood choices also affect their children's future choices? I develop a quantitative spatial model of parental decisions that incorporates a novel mechanism: social learning about the technology of skill formation. Segregation generates information frictions that systematically distort parents' subjective beliefs and behavior. Using several United States representative datasets, I calibrate the model to the average commuting zone in the country. The calibrated model matches targeted and non-targeted parental behaviors and generates an endogenous distribution of subjective beliefs. I find that a relatively modest level of delusion increases inequality by 3% and decreases social mobility by 12%. Housing vouchers improve the neighborhood quality of eligible families, raising children's future earnings. When scaled-up, general equilibrium responses in local prices and subjective beliefs amplify the policy effects on eligible households, reducing inequality and improving social mobility. Ignoring subjective belief responses greatly undermines the policy effects."

**Abstract**:

United States parents’ neighborhood choices shape their children’s economic opportunities. However, most children raised in bottom-quality neighborhoods still live in low-quality neighborhoods in adulthood. Do parents' neighborhood choices also affect their children's future choices? After providing empirical evidence on this relationship, I develop a quantitative spatial model of parental decisions that incorporates a novel mechanism: community learning about the technology of skill formation. Segregation generates information frictions that systematically distort parents' subjective beliefs and behavior. Using several United States representative datasets, I calibrate the model to the average commuting zone in the country. The calibrated model helps understand targeted and non-targeted parental behavior across socioeconomic groups. Under perfect information, inequality decreases by 3%, and social mobility increases by 13%. Housing vouchers improve neighborhood quality and earnings of eligible low-income children. At scale, however, general equilibrium responses in local prices and subjective beliefs dampen the policy effects on inequality and social mobility
