summary: "This paper assesses the consequences of early school tracking on intergenerational social mobility and inequalities in Germany. We develop a quantitative, overlapping-generation life-cycle model in which we incorporate two critical elements of the debate around tracking in school: (i) homogeneous peer groups enhance learning (ii) however, there is uncertainty about the skills of young children and a strong influence of the socio-economic situation of the parents in the tracking decision. We quantify each channel by calibrating the model to match NEPS test score data---a representative panel of German pupils. We then use the calibrated model to assess the consequences of postponing school tracking on social mobility, inequality, and efficiency.
