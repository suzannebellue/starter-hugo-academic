summary: "Although in-service teacher training programs are designed to enhance the performance of several cohorts of students, there is little evidence on the persistence of their effects. We present the two-year results of a large-scale randomized study of an intensive in-service teacher training program conducted in France during and after the training program's implementation year. Our results highlight the short-run effectiveness of the training program: it successfully improves students' performance but only during the implementation year. A detailed analysis of teachers' outcomes indicates that teachers changed their pedagogical vision and practices but struggled to apply skills to contents not directly covered during training."
