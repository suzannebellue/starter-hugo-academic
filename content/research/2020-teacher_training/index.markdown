summary: "We conduct a randomized study to assess the impact of an in-service teacher training program on inquiry-based learning in science in French primary schools. The study comprises 134 randomly assigned volunteer teachers and two cohorts of about 2,500 students. In addition to student test scores, we collect information on teacher practices and pedagogical knowledge. We find that the training program
(80 hours over two years) increases the weekly hours of science instruction as well as the number of science experiments conducted in class. Yet, one year later, most of these effects disappear. Consistently, while we find small effects on students’ scientific knowledge during the last year of the training program, these effects are also short-lived. These results highlight the difficulty to train experienced
teachers in a way that has deep and long-lasting influence on their practices."
